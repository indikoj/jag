# JAG

---
This is an attempt to take back control over our personal data, and thus put ourselves
in charge of our own future.

**JAG** is an acronym based on Swedish words and stands for:

- **J**ag (I)
- **A**rbete (Work) as in what results in monetary income
- **G**emenskaper (Communities) as in partnerships and organisations we voluntarily join

Until further notice, since the author lives in and is a citizen of Sweden, everything
is based on how things works in Sweden.

## Goal - There is no goal
### ...only make better for yourself and others!

Life is an ongoing process, and we as humans are able to record our knowledge and history
for our children and future generations benefits.

Still we are busy ruining not only our children's future, it is now so bad we are ruining
our own future of having a happy life. Where global warming is mainly of our own making!

Why?

- Much because so much is still a transactional competition between winners and losers!

As long as that continues - every human will in the end be a loser!

One of my favorite phrases in Swedish is:

- Ömsesidigt värdeskapande

In English, it means "mutual value creation." It is the opposite of the transactional
Zero-Sum game we humans have been playing for so many generations.

This way the value isn't a fixed one thing that is divided between competitors. Instead
it is about ongoing collaboration on making things better - all things.

Let's try that instead!

## Motto: Skynda långsamt och tänk efter före

English: "Hurry slowly and think before"

So much in our society is rushed, and it is not looking to slow down. This means shortcuts
are taken, too often in blind belief they will work out - which they seldom do.

Result is that we pay for those shortcuts later, many times over. And we don't learn!

Therefor, **JAG** is in no hurry. I will take the time needed to learn before adding
well-thought-out features that solve causes, not consequences.

## Open Source is the future <3
It is, in my opinion, the best way to avoid unwanted competition distractions.

Thus, this idea is beginning to take shape using:

- Python 3.11
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS)
- MIT License
