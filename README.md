# JAG

---
This is an attempt to simplify our everydays, including smarter ways of organizing
and managing our personal assets and data, while being able to collaborate better with others.

**JAG** is an acronym based on Swedish words and stands for:

- **J**ag (I)
- **A**rbete (Work) as in what results in monetary income
- **G**emenskaper (Communities) as in partnerships and organisations we voluntarily join

Until further notice, since the author lives in and is a citizen of Sweden, everything
is based on how things works in Sweden.

## Open Source is the future <3
It is, in my opinion, the best way to avoid unwanted negaive situations in the future.

Thus, this idea is beginning to take shape using:

- Python 3.11
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS)
- MIT License

Everyone is welcome to join.
